# Password Generator

## My Task

This project was givent to me so that I could modify code to create a pass word generator application that according to the user story is secure. This application will prompt the user the length of their desired password and 4 types of characters that they would like in their password. The final output is an assortment of randomly selected characters to fit the desired length. This was all constructed using HTML, JS, and CSS. I polished the code and made it accessible.
