# Password Generator

## My Task

This project was givent to me so that I could modify code to create a pass word generator application that according to the user story is secure. This application will prompt the user the length of their desired password and 4 types of characters that they would like in their password. The final output is an assortment of randomly selected characters to fit the desired length. This was all constructed using HTML, JS, and CSS. I polished the code and made it accessible.

## This code includes the following

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
